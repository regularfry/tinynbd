These benchmarks (such as they are) were generated as follows.

1. Make a wheezy VM as a raw disc image from the netinst installer.

2. Add the following line in /etc/rc.local:

    bonnie++ -q -b -d /root/ && shutdown -h now

3. In one shell, run this line:

    $ for i in `seq 1 10`; do ./build/$TEST_SERVER discs/wheezybonnie.img 5555; done 

4. In another, run this line:

    $ for i in `seq 1 10`; do \
        echo "free && sync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches && free" | sudo sh;\
        /usr/bin/time --output $TEST_SERVER.bench -a \
          ./run.sh nbd:127.0.0.1:5555 -nographic;\
        echo "done $i";\
      done

where `run.sh` looks like this:

    #!/bin/bash

    disc=$1
    shift
    qemu/build/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 --enable-kvm -m 1024 --drive file=$disc,format=raw,if=virtio $@

For those servers which speak over a unix domain socket, the disc spec
looks like this:

    nbd:file:/path/to/file

baseline.bench was generated by telling qemu to access the disc image
directly:

    file=/path/to/file

Qemu version is git master on 2015-02-13, commit
cd2d5541271f1934345d8ca42f5fafff1744eee7.

Flexnbd version is current tip, commit 453:9753d8c65725.  It was *not* a
debug build.
